"""Single entry-point dispatch for every way Cove is launched.

Both `python -m cove` (cove/__main__.py) and the frozen PyInstaller binary
(packaging/launcher.py) MUST route through here.

Why this exists: a browser starts the native messaging host by executing the
registered command. If that command lands in the GUI instead of the stdio
host, the GUI can't complete the native-messaging handshake, the browser
reports a connection error and immediately respawns the host -- an endless
loop of download-manager windows that can take the machine down. The frozen
launcher used to import cove.app.run directly and never checked the flag,
which is exactly how that loop shipped. Centralizing the dispatch keeps the
two entry points from drifting apart again.
